Abalone is a marine snail inhabiting cold coastal waters, highly valued based on its age,
usually determined through time-consuming laboratory procedures. In this regard, this
work aims to construct predictive models for fast and accurate abalone age estimation
using advanced machine learning techniques. Algorithms applied to a dataset of physical
characteristics included Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support
Vector Machine. Model performance was measured using R-squared with RÂ² and RMSE.
The proposed method is a replaceable alternative to the conventionally technique-based
methods with data-driven efficient solutions, which contribute to the advancement of
studies in abalone ecological research and commercial operations in the abalone industry
